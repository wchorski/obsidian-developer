## [vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync (github.com)](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync/)
Self-hosted LiveSync is a community implemented synchronization plugin.  
A self-hosted or purchased CouchDB acts as the intermediate server. Available on every obsidian-compatible platform.

This is how I keep my [pywriter](../../pywriter.md) vault in sync between my **phone** and other devices. I also use it to sync up with my **Dungeon's & Dragons** vault.
